## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hiï¼ŒIâ€™m Eilvo,a passionate FE developer & Independent developer,and a fan of Pieter Level.

I have a passion for JavaScript and consider it an elegant language.I am good at JavaScript,Typescript,VUE and NUXT.Currently,I am exploring React and Node.

If I have spare time in the future, I will continue to explore in the direction of engineeringization, efficiency-enhancing tools and IDEs.

I am very interested in the underlying principles of many excellent open-source projects, such as VSCode, Webpack, Vite, etc. I hope that one day I can create a mini version of them.

My interests also lie in researching and developing various AI products and exploring the specific demands in daily life.

I hope to make friends with you and participate in all kinds of interesting, challenging and enjoyable projects.Work together to create greater value for this world!
